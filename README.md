# Stack and Queue using Linked List

This repository contains C++ programs for implementing a Stack and a Queue data structure using a linked list. Each program includes a menu-driven interface that allows you to perform various operations on the respective data structures. Below are instructions on how to use and understand the code.

## Queue

### Program Description
- The `Queue` program implements a queue using a linked list. It provides the following operations:
  - Enqueue: Adds an element to the end of the queue.
  - Dequeue: Removes an element from the front of the queue.
  - Display: Displays the elements in the queue.
  
### How to Use
1. Compile and run the program.
2. Select the appropriate operation (1 for Enqueue, 2 for Dequeue, 3 for Display, 4 for Exit) using the menu.
3. If you choose to Enqueue, you can enter data for a node. You can enqueue multiple nodes.
4. If you choose to Dequeue, it will remove and display the item that was dequeued.
5. If you choose to Display, it will show the current elements in the queue.
6. Repeat the process as needed.

### Program Description
- The `Stack` program implements a stack using a linked list. It provides the following operations:
  - Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
  - Pop: Removes an element from the top of the stack.
  - Display: Displays the elements in the stack.

### How to Use
1. Compile and run the program.
2. Select the appropriate operation (1 for Push, 2 for Pop, 3 for Display, 4 for Exit) using the menu.
3. If you choose to Push, you can enter data for a node. You can push multiple nodes.
4. If you choose to Pop, it will remove and display the item that was popped.
5. If you choose to Display, it will show the current elements in the stack.
6. Repeat the process as needed.

## Important Notes
- Both programs use a simple menu-driven interface to interact with the data structures.
- You can enqueue/push multiple elements before performing other operations.
- The programs provide feedback on the successful enqueue or pop operation.
- The data structure is implemented using a linked list, making it dynamic in size.
- These programs use a basic console interface and may not handle error cases such as memory allocation failures or invalid user inputs. You can enhance error handling as needed.

Feel free to use and modify these programs as needed for your specific use case. Enjoy working with stacks and queues using linked lists!
